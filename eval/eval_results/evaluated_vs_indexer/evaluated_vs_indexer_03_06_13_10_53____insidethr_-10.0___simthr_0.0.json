One key difference is that KANs have both external degrees of freedom (dofs) and internal dofs, while traditional neural networks typically only have external dofs. External dofs are responsible for learning compositional structures of multiple variables, while internal dofs are responsible for learning univariate functions. Additionally, KANs have learnable activation functions, whereas traditional neural networks often have fixed activation functions. KANs also have the ability to introduce adaptivity in their design and training, which can enhance both accuracy and efficiency.",

        "llm_answer_indexer": "KANs (Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks) use several novel methods for problem-solving, including:\n\n1. Learnable Activation Functions: KANs have learnable activation functions, which means that the activation functions can be adjusted during the training process. This allows the network to adapt and optimize the activation functions based on the specific problem being solved.\n\n2. Adaptivity: KANs utilize the intrinsic locality of spline basis functions to introduce adaptivity in the design and training process. This helps enhance both accuracy and efficiency in solving problems.\n\n3. Multi-level Training: KANs incorporate the idea of multi-level training, similar to multigrid methods, to further improve the performance of the network. This involves training the network at different levels of granularity or resolution.\n\n4. Pruning: After training, KANs can prune the network to create a smaller subnetwork. This is done on the node level, where unimportant neurons are pruned based on their incoming and outgoing scores.\n\n5. Symbolification: KANs provide an interface to set activation functions to be a specified symbolic form, such as cos or log. This allows for the incorporation of symbolic knowledge into the network.\n\nThese methods contribute to the effectiveness of KANs in solving various problems, including fitting physical equations, solving partial differential equations (PDEs), and other regression or PDE-solving tasks.",
