Fortunately,KANsusuallyallowmuchsmallercompu-\ntation graphs than MLPs. For example, we show that for PDE solving, a 2-Layer width-10 KAN\nis 100 times more accurate than a 4-Layer width-100 MLP (10\u22127 vs 10\u22125 MSE) and 100 times\nmoreparameterefficient(102vs104parameters).\nUnsurprisingly,thepossibilityofusingKolmogorov-Arnoldrepresentationtheoremtobuildneural\nnetworks has been studied [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13].

Unfortunately, overweight and, in particular, obesity are correlated to various\nrisk factors for cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, type 2 diabetes and other diseases [3]. Obesity corresponds to an excess of fat\nmass in the body due to poor dietary habits associated with an overly sedentary lifestyle and physical inactivity [4,5].\nThus, both sedentary behaviors and physical inactivity strengthen the risk of developing overweight and obesity already during\nchildhood [6,7].

Furthermore, students with obesity need to develop skills and participate in activities just like their peers in an\nenvironment that accommodates their motor abilities while ensuring their safety [20].

Furthermore, low physical activity levels associate with poorer performance and low levels of several fitness components,\nsuch as muscle strength and cardiorespiratory fitness [42], which creates a vicious circle capable of worsening obesity, thus negatively\nimpacting psycho-physical well-being [43,44]. It is difficult for obese young people to engage in physical activity, so it becomes\nnecessary to design different approaches to physical activity, i.e. adapted to their abilities in order to encourage adherence. Many\nstudies show that, at school level, multicomponent interventions are effective in improving eating behavior and physical activity levels\nof children and adolescents who are overweight or obese [7,21,25,28].\nWe hypothesized that a program of adapted physical activity can be useful to provide management of youth obesity, decreasing\nFig. 3.

In particular, the best\nresults obtained on girls are of significant interest, as earlier research has revealed that girls not only face more impediment to physical\nactivity than boys [45], but that boys are more likely to experience enjoyment from physical activities [46,47].\nFurthermore, although some women reported remind positive and pleasant feelings during physical activity in childhood, they\nwere no longer evident during their adolesc",

In fact, the perception of low athletic capacity [49], the feeling of embarrassment about one\u2019s\nphysical appearance together with the negative perception of one\u2019s body represent the main obstacles to physical activity for girls [50].\nAs is known, physical exercise produces sensations of pleasure that depend on the participation and commitment of students in the\nactivity carried out [51]; thus, our results substantiate antecedent research which demonstrated that enjoyment is a construct related\nto physical activity, enthusiasm, and involvement of students [46].\nHowever, sensations of pleasure are inversely related to the intensity of the exercise.
